Analysis of the vertical shot from the Grot rifle.
The aim of the analysis was to assess whether a vertical shot from a Grot rifle poses any risks, i.e. whether a falling cartridge is capable of harming someone. The simulation result shows that although the kinetic energy of a falling bullet is only 18.5 J (only in comparison to the energy at the moment of firing, which is 1600 J), hitting a person with a sharpened cartridge flying with energy of 18.5 J (the energy of air guns available without a permit) can be dangerous for a person.
